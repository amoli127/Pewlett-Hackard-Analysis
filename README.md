# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

## Project Overview

### Purpose

Pewlett Hackard is a company preparing for a significant portion of its employees to retire in the next few years, and they need to know what positions need to be filled. This analysis aims to determine the number of employees who will retire based on titles and the eligibility of employees to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results

The Number of Retiring Employees by Title

  - We wrote a query to create a table containing the number of employees born between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955.
